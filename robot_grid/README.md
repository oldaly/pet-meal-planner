ðŸ¤– Robot Task Description
Create a Robot class that simulates movement on a 2D grid.

The robot starts at position (0, 0).
The robot can receive instructions:
'U' = move up
'D' = move down
'L' = move left
'R' = move right
Implement a method to process a string of instructions (e.g., "UUDDLR").
Optionally: prevent the robot from going outside the bounds of a grid (like 5Ã—5).
Add a method to return the robot's current position.
